## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
**Visual Elements:**
- Fade in from black to Chorus logo
- Animated network diagram showing agent connections
- Red warning indicators appearing across the network
- Text overlay: "Autonomous systems create unpredictable failures"

**Audio Script:**
> "Autonomous systems are everywhere - from CDN networks to trading algorithms. But they have a fatal flaw: they create cascading failures that cost millions. Current tools are reactive, not predictive. What if we could prevent these failures before they happen?"

**Technical Notes:**
- Use smooth transitions and professional animations
- Keep text overlays minimal and readable
- Background music: Subtle, tech-focused ambient

### Scene 2: Solution Introduction (0:30 - 1:00)
**Visual Elements:**
- Transition to live terminal/dashboard view
- Chorus system initialization sequence
- Partner technology logos appearing
- System status indicators turning green

**Audio Script:**
> "Meet Chorus - the world's first AI-powered immune system for multi-agent networks. Built with Google Gemini for AI prediction, Datadog for observability, Confluent for real-time streaming, and ElevenLabs for voice alerts. Let me show you how it works."

**Technical Notes:**
- Screen recording of actual system startup
- Highlight partner integrations prominently
- Smooth zoom transitions between UI elements

### Scene 3: Live Agent Creation (1:00 - 1:30)
**Visual Elements:**
- Terminal showing agent creation commands
- Agent cards appearing in dashboard
- Trust scores being assigned
- Network topology visualization

**Audio Script:**
> "I'm creating a network of autonomous agents - edge servers in a CDN system. Each agent has a trust score based on its behavior. Watch what happens when they start competing for resources."

**Technical Notes:**
- Split screen: terminal and web dashboard
- Highlight trust scores with visual emphasis
- Use cursor highlighting for key information

### Scene 4: AI Conflict Prediction (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual Elements:**
- Gemini API analysis in progress
- Risk score calculation animation
- Conflict prediction results display
- Real-time latency measurements

**Audio Script:**
> "Chorus uses Google Gemini AI to analyze agent interactions in real-time. Game theory, behavioral patterns, resource contention - all processed in under 50 milliseconds. Here's the analysis: 78% risk of cascading failure due to synchronized cache misses. The AI predicts exactly what would happen and recommends immediate intervention."

**Technical Notes:**
- Close-up on risk score animation
- Highlight sub-50ms response time
- Show actual Gemini API response data

### Scene 5: Automated Intervention (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual Elements:**
- Intervention trigger animation
- Agent quarantine process
- System status returning to green
- Cost savings calculation

**Audio Script:**
> "Automatic intervention triggered. The problematic agent is quarantined before it can cause a cascade. Disaster prevented. That just saved us 2.5 million dollars in 42 milliseconds. This isn't just monitoring - this is predictive prevention."

**Technical Notes:**
- Dramatic visual effects for intervention
- Emphasize speed and automation
- Show clear before/after system state

### Scene 6: Business Value Summary (3:00 - 3:30)
**Visual Elements:**
- ROI calculation animation
- Partner technology showcase
- Production deployment indicators
- Enterprise security badges

**Audio Script:**
> "The results speak for themselves: sub-50ms predictions, 95% accuracy, millions in prevented losses. Built on enterprise-grade architecture with industry-leading partners. Production-ready today."

**Technical Notes:**
- Professional business graphics
- Partner logos with integration indicators
- Clean, corporate visual style

### Scene 7: Call to Action (3:30 - 4:00)
**Visual Elements:**

- Social media handles
- Fade to Chorus logo

**Audio Script:**
> "Ready to prevent your next cascading failure? Visit chorus-demo.company.com for a live demonstration, or contact us at chorus-sales@company.com. The future of AI safety is here. The question is: will you be part of it?"

**Technical Notes:**
- Clear, readable contact information
- Professional closing animation
- Memorable final message
