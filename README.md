# Chorus: Multi-Agent Immune System

A real-time safety layer for decentralized multi-agent systems that predicts and prevents emergent failures before they cascade.

## Overview

Chorus is an intelligent conflict prediction and intervention system designed for decentralized multi-agent networks. It uses advanced game theory analysis powered by Google's Gemini 3 Pro API to predict potential conflicts and automatically intervene to prevent cascading failures.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Conflict Prediction**: <50ms prediction of agent conflicts using game theory
- **Cascading Failure Prevention**: Automatic quarantine of compromised agents
- **Emergent Behavior Mapping**: Causal graph visualization of agent interactions
- **Voice-First Alerts**: Natural language incident reporting via ElevenLabs

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 3 Pro API
- **Monitoring**: Datadog integration
- **Streaming**: Confluent Kafka
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs API

## Getting Started

This project is currently in development. More documentation will be added as features are implemented.
